//===============Variables naming conventions =============================
//let 3year = 456; > invalid name > You can't start a variable with a number
//Variables names can only contain letters, numbers, dollar signs and underscores
//don't use reserve keyword to name variables
//Don't call your variables name because it is a reserved word

let $myMoney = 1000;
let my_money = 145;

//CamelCase it's consider the defacto standard for naming variables in JavaScript

//Variables names should be descriptive
let myFirstJob = 'Engineer';
let mySecondJob = 'Lawyer';
