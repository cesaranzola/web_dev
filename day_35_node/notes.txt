//Node is Javascript that runs outside of the browser, so you not longer have access to the DOM.
// Node is a Javascript runtime > An implementation of Javascript that runs outside of the browser
// Node > use the same Javascript syntax to write code that runs on the server side
// Node > you don't have to learn another separate language to run server side code

//What do people build with Node?
// Web servers 
// Command line tools
// Native apps > VSCode is a Node app
// Video games
// Drone Software
// NASA uses node to keep astronauts safe during space walks
// Node has a REPL(read, evaluate, print, loop) - interactive computer programming enviromment 
// browser console is also a REPL
//Usuallly you use a REPL to debud or play around with some new features.
// Node is a Javascript runtime > If you access its REPL, you can type Javascript code just like if you were in your browser's console


//Node > type node to enter the REPL, and then .help > to access a man page with some commands and explantions
// Node > althrough it doesn't come with the DOM cappabilities, it has its own methods 
// The window object found in a browser is present but with a different name > it's called global
// You have console.log but it's different from that of the browser
// You can access a node.js script by typing its relative or absolute path, just like you can with any type of file


//Bear in mind that Node is a beast on itself, you can take a 40-hour tutorial that it's just about Node. And then another 40-hour for a tutorial on how to use node to build x.
// node -v > to check which version of node you have
// You can have different node versions, according to the project you're working on.
// You can use nvm - node version manager
