Node express
It's a framework
It's a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It help us build web apps.

It's a Npm package which comes with a bunch of methods and optional plugins that we can use to build web applications and API's

Express help us to:
1. Start up a server to listen for requests
2. Parse incoming request
3. Match those requests to particular routes 
4. Craft out http response and associated content


Libraries vs Frameworks
Libraries - When you use a library, you are in charge!
You control the flow of the application code
You decide when to include the library
Libraries often make small actions for us or gives single purpose capabilities like Axios(making http request)

Frameworks - the control is inverted
The Framework is in charge, and you are merely a participant
The Framework tells you where to plug in the code
Frameworks are geared toward building full applications


Express is a lightweight framework
